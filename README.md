# 🚀 Employee Tracker SQL

A terminal-based application for managing departments, roles, and employees.

## 📌 Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- **Motivation:**  
  My motivation is to develop a user-friendly interface that enables non-developers to access and interact with database information efficiently. These interfaces, known as content management systems (CMS), streamline this process. The task is to create a command-line application from the ground up to manage a company's employee database, utilizing Node.js, Inquirer, and PostgreSQL.

- **What I Learned:**  
  - **Using Node.js:**  
    - Develop a command-line application leveraging Node.js for server-side scripting.
  - **Utilizing Inquirer Package:**  
    - Implement a user-friendly interface in the command line to interact with the application.
  - **Working with PostgreSQL and pg Package:**  
    - Connect to a PostgreSQL database using the `pg` package.  
    - Perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on database records.
  - **Database Design:**  
    - Follow a specified table schema, gaining experience in structuring relational databases.

## 📥 Installation

Ensure you have the following installed before running the application:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (Latest LTS recommended)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) (for database management)

### Install Dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

## 🚀 Running the Application

### 1️⃣ Compile TypeScript  
Since the project uses TypeScript, compile it before running:

```sh
npm run build
```
This generates the JavaScript output in the `dist` folder.

### 2️⃣ Start the Application  
Run the application with:

```sh
npm start
```
This executes `node dist/server.js`, starting the app.

### 3️⃣ Development Mode (Optional)  
For automatic compilation while making changes, you can use:

```sh
npx ts-node server.ts
```

Or install `nodemon` globally and run:

```sh
npm install -g nodemon
nodemon --ext ts server.ts
```
