## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- Motivation: My motion is develop user-friendly interface that enables  non-developers to access and interact with database information efficiently. These interfaces, known as content management systems (CMS), streamline this process.  The task is to create a command-line application from the ground up to manage a company's employee database, utilizing Node.js, Inquirer, and PostgreSQL.

- What I Learned: 
    - Using Node.js:
        - Develop a command-line application leveraging Node.js for server-side scripting.
    - Utilizing Inquirer Package:
        - Implement a user-friendly interface in the command line to interact with the application.
    - Working with PostgreSQL and pg Package:
        - Connect to a PostgreSQL database using the pg package.
        - Perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on database records.
    - Database Design:
     - Follow a specified table schema, gaining experience in structuring relational databases.
